I am a Postdoc in the group of [Guido Mont&uacute;far](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/) at [MPI MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/montufar/index.html), where I work on algorithmic regularization and capacity control in deep neural networks.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Leipzig University](https://www.fmi.uni-leipzig.de/cms/en/startseite/) under the supervision of [J&uuml;rgen Jost](https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/jjost/juergen-jost.html) at MPI MiS. Before joining MPI, I obtained my Masters and Bachelors degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.
